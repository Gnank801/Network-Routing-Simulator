## Objective

This project involves simulating two fundamental routing algorithms:
- **Distance Vector Routing (DVR)**
- **Link State Routing (LSR)**

Both algorithms are implemented in C++ using an adjacency matrix input, representing the network topology. The program computes the shortest paths and displays the routing tables for each node accordingly.

---

## Files Included

- `routing_sim.cpp`: Main C++ implementation of the DVR and LSR algorithms.
- `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, `input3.txt`, `input4.txt`: Sample input files containing adjacency matrices.
- `README.md`: This file.

---

## How to Compile and Run

### 1. **Compile**
```bash
g++ -o routing_sim routing_sim.cpp
```

### 2. **Run**
```bash
./routing_sim input1.txt
```

Replace `input1.txt` with any input file from the list.

---

## Input Format

Each input file contains:
- An integer `n` (number of nodes)
- An `n x n` adjacency matrix representing the cost between nodes

**Conventions:**
- `0` on the diagonal (self-loops)
- `9999` represents no direct connection (infinite cost)

---

## Sample Inputs & Outputs

### `input1.txt`
```
4
0 10 100 30
10 0 20 40
100 20 0 10
30 40 10 0
```

### Corresponding Output (Excerpt)
```
--- Distance Vector Routing Simulation ---
Node 0 Routing Table:
Dest	Cost	Next Hop
0	0	-
1	10	1
2	30	1
3	30	3
...

--- Link State Routing Simulation ---
Node 0 Routing Table:
Dest	Cost	Next Hop
1	10	1
2	30	1
3	30	3
...
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Distance Vector Routing (DVR)
- Based on **Bellman-Ford algorithm**
- Each node exchanges routing info with neighbors
- Updates continue until convergence (no more changes)
- Output: Routing tables after convergence

### Link State Routing (LSR)
- Based on **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**
- Each node computes shortest paths using full topology
- Output: Final routing table per node

---

## Output Format

For both algorithms, each node's routing table is printed in the format:

```
Node <i> Routing Table:
Dest	Cost	Next Hop
<dest1>	<cost>	<next hop>
...
```

---

## Notes

- The program handles unreachable nodes (`9999`) appropriately.
- Tested with various topologies (`input1.txt` to `input4.txt`) to verify correctness.
- Makefile is optional; compilation via `g++` is direct.
